These are engineers who have served various engineering organisations at senior positions. Based on the experience in selecting and   handling of manpower of various level, especially from fresh graduate engineers, a need was felt to refresh their engineering fundamentals. 
Though industry trains recruited fresh engineers, they expect fundamentals to be clear. This includes basic physics, mathematics, mechanics, design principles, drawings, and manufacturing processes. We are sure that you might have gone through this frustrating experience.
Based on our experience, we have designed a training program which will try to refresh some of the topics, focusing on the minimum essential expectations of industry.  It is not possible to provide industry specific training considering multiplicity. 
Over the years it is being mentioned in various survey reports that fresh graduates of any stream need extensive training before they are productively useful to the company.  All companies do not have sufficient time and resources to do this. 
Considering the above fact we have started  training programs for job functions like DESIGN, PRODUCTION, QUALITY, PROJECTS, PURCHASE, ESTIMATION, MAINTENANCE, ERECTION-COMMISSIONING.......ETC.

And looking at the current policy of ""make in India gaining momentum, demand for trained engineers goes on increasing.  Every person must extend support within his capability towards this goal of make in India. 
Our above training program is an effort in this direction. 
We wish to seek your support....

,,"Casting Rolls","Rolling mills are increasingly demanding rolls which are capable to maintain the shape and profile much longer with the aim to extend the length of campaigns. The state of the surface is one of the criteria determining the roll change. The premature failure of rolls is major concern amongst the mill-buyers as it adversely effects the mill operation and production.

Rolling mills value the rolls by the cost of uses and the excellent quality of the obtained surface on the rolled product Hence  they do the desired analysis before purchasing the rolls and their focus of selection revolves around - 
·      Increasing the quality level,
·      Improving productivity,
·      Reducing the production costs by means of reliable equipment. 

Roll manufacturing plays a significant role in the performance of the roll. Rolling mills have specific requirements based on mill type and hence the stress level of the roll also changes which forms one of the basic criteria for the manufacturers. To get the desired results , roll manufacturer must carefully choose the material whose properties will be optimized and hence have to be very particular about heating , cadence, and rolling speed of the rolled products.

 Our team understands the overall requirements of the rolling mills and try to match the specific requirements based on mill type with the roll manufacturer to provide a well optimized product. We  make sure that due diligence is done before the order is placed to the concerned manufacturers and some of the criterias we follow (taking into consideration the basic needs of  the rolling mills) are :-

Most of the time, we come across an idea, but dont give importance, we have a portrait, but dont know how to frame it, we have a design, but dont know how to manufacture it. 

One of the best examples of Invention & Inventors is, of the people who have graduated or are still studying from Engineering Faculty come across Projects. But by then Project is only a medium to finish the graduation and advance into a later stage of professionalism. And everyone forgets the time spent or will forget the efforts, laid to find a unique Project and then by strong will & hard work turning it into a Product. At that time the primary goal is to build something cool and unique from other kids and get done with the submission.

There are no boundaries and limitations to gain knowledge and the ways to garner as much information as possible keep on opening if we trade that path without any reservations. It is a continuous process and talking in engineering terms, the productivity on this path keeps on increasing, irrespective of ones age or experience. It is not the theoretical knowledge we are talking about, since that is limited to the educational institutions. Here, we are emphasising on attaining the wisdom by sharing the learnings in a systematic way and through proper documentation.

Technology, vis-à-vis knowledge, has always been witnessing advancements through various researches and practical applications. In its effort to channelise resources and bring them all on one platform, www.cnctimes.com has evolved various means through which knowledge from CNC technology domain in general and machine tool industry in particular, can be summarised and documented in a systematic way to disseminate it among the practicing as well as future engineers.

The sole purpose behind this is to share the experiences of industry wizards and reduce the learning curve of the GenNext engineers, albeit marginally. By following the notes and anecdotes mentioned by these veterans, the engineering community can get enriched with practical knowledge. If followed properly, this will help the upcoming engineers gain an advantage over their peers.

CNCTimes has been doing this for the past 21 years through technical articles, preparing case studies, noting down success stories and updating the industry with latest happenings. And the medium it has chosen by CNCTimes to spread the K word is web-based which has global attentiveness. By just registering on the website, one can explore not only the latest technological advancements, but can also access wealth of information which can help him in getting rich, not monetarily but academically.","Mechanical or Industrial Engineering","2-10 employees","Privately Held","Pune, Maharashtra","India","cnctimes.com","https://www.linkedin.com/company/cnctimescompany",,,,,,,,,

,,"The Indian Card Clothing Company Ltd.","The Indian Card Clothing Co. Ltd has been an innovator in card clothing manufacturing since its inception in 1955. Originally a joint venture between Carclo Engineering Group and English Card Clothing, this company was established to solidify the presence of these private industries in India by shifting their manufacturing for the Indian market to the domestic level. After Carclo acquired English Card Clothing in 1979, it became the largest, global card clothing manufacturer and provider. ICC helped pioneer this change, through the development of metallic card clothing, replacing flexibles in the cotton carding process. In 1978, following Indira Gandhis Foreign Exchange Regulation Act (1973), Carclo diluted its share from 100% to 74%, with the outstanding shares being offered to domestic directors, employees and the general public. Finally, in 1985, English Card Clothing (a complete subsidiary of Carclo) sold its 57% stake in ICC, divesting its controlling interest and allowing the company to take on new management.

ICC continues its heritage of innovation: there was a concerned effort to develop and now grow the export sales and markets available to us; we strive to be the leading innovator in cardroom solutions and accessories. Now we are in over 18 overseas markets and aim to consistently grow and build new synergies across the globe. This will only be achieved through the consistent innovation required from any company to remain relevant and invaluable to their customers. Our work will always begin and end with our customer.","Mechanical or Industrial Engineering","201-500 employees","Public Company","Pune, Maharashtra","India","cardindia.com","https://www.linkedin.com/company/indian-card-clothing-company-ltd",,,,,,,,,
